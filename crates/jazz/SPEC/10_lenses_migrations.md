# jazz — Specification · 10. Schema evolution: lenses & migrations

## Overview

Multiple schema versions coexist in one database, and migration lenses translate
between them without rewriting history. This is one of jazz's most novel
properties. This chapter defines the catalogue, shared physical storage,
authored-schema writes, and lens-projected reads. It builds on schema
identity (ch. 2), history winner selection (ch. 4), and the catalogue sync lane
(ch. 8).

Invariant digest:

- `INV-LENS-1`: A published `SchemaVersion` MUST have `schema.id == schema.schema.version_id()`; every non-genesis schema MUST be admitted in one catalogue operation with its lineage-defining lens before it is known or writeable.
- `INV-LENS-2`: A published `MigrationLens` MUST have `lens.id == lens.content_id()` and both `lens.source` and `lens.target` MUST be known `SchemaVersionId`s; `content_id()` MUST hash the canonical lens payload and exclude the embedded id field.
- `INV-LENS-3`: Catalogue mutation messages MUST be accepted only from catalogue admin identity and MUST reject non-admin authors.
- `INV-LENS-4`: Every stored content/register history row MUST carry a schema-version alias, and every wire `VersionRecord` MUST expose the full `SchemaVersionId`.
- `INV-LENS-5`: Unknown-schema commit units MUST park without ingesting a transaction and MUST drain when the corresponding `SchemaVersion` catalogue value arrives.
- `INV-LENS-6`: Unknown-schema shape registrations MUST park and MUST register only after the named schema-version catalogue value arrives.
- `INV-LENS-7`: `CurrentWriteSchema` updates MUST be monotone by `revision`; stale revisions MUST leave `current_write_schema` unchanged.
- `INV-LENS-8`: Durable catalogue schemas, lenses, current-write pointer, schema-version aliases, and physical mappings MUST survive node restart; installing an authority snapshot MUST preserve the node-local storage identity of an already-open schema so pre-snapshot local writes remain addressable.
- `INV-LENS-9`: Publishing a non-genesis schema and its lineage-defining lens MUST durably stage the complete ordered bundle, keep it invisible while every physical table and schema variant is registered, then durably activate it before acknowledging or draining parked work; reopen MUST resume staged activation idempotently.
- `INV-LENS-10`: New local writes MUST retain `current_write_schema.schema` as their schema discriminator and resolve storage through that schema's durable physical mapping.
- `INV-LENS-11`: Incoming commit units MUST retain their authored schema discriminator and resolve storage through that schema's durable physical mapping, even when the current write pointer names another schema.
- `INV-LENS-12`: Natural lens reads MUST select winners from the shared physical lineage before projecting rows into the requested schema.
- `INV-LENS-13`: Natural lens projection MUST apply supported operations deterministically in both directions and MUST reject unsupported transformations.
- `INV-LENS-14`: For every non-rejected natural lens delta sequence, translating then applying MUST equal applying then translating for all known schema materializations.
- `INV-LENS-15`: `ShapeId` MUST include the authored `SchemaVersionId`; identical canonical query bytes against different schema versions MUST produce different shape ids.
- `INV-LENS-16`: A commit unit MUST NOT be rejected or rewritten solely because its authored schema differs from the current write schema.
- `INV-LENS-17`: TransformColumn MUST be accepted only when its transform key is registered as bijective and canonical-equality-preserving.
- `INV-LENS-18`: Large-value columns MAY be renamed by a lens but MUST NOT be content-transformed.
- `INV-LENS-19`: Policy evaluation under lenses MUST translate data into the pinned permission evaluation schema and MUST NOT translate policy bundles.
- `INV-LENS-20`: Published physical lineages and authored schema variants MUST NOT be automatically garbage-collected.

## Details

### 10.1 The model

Schema evolution is modeled as immutable catalogue data plus explicit
translations between versions. A `SchemaVersion` names one content-addressed
schema snapshot. A `MigrationLens` names a pure, deterministic translation
between two `SchemaVersionId`s, so old and new materializations can coexist while
presenting a coherent view to readers and writers. Incoming commits retain the
schema in which they were authored; translation happens when a read requests a
different schema, not while history is ingested.

Each lens is bidirectional: it defines behavior in **both** directions, forward
for old→new and backward for new→old. A direction may instead be declared as
`RejectSourceDelta`, which refuses that explicit projection rather than
producing a translated value. It does not reject a commit merely because its
authored schema differs from the write pointer (§10.4). Publishing a schema or a
lens **never rewrites existing history**. Rows remain in the version where they
were authored, and translation happens at read time (§10.5).

Identity is content-addressed. `SchemaVersionId = JazzSchema::version_id()`
(ch. 2), and `MigrationLensId = lens.content_id()`. The lens id hashes a
canonical byte encoding of the source id, target id, declared table lenses,
ordered lens ops, and recursively tagged default values. The embedded
`MigrationLens.id` field is excluded from that encoding, and catalogue ingest
rejects a mismatched id (`INV-LENS-1`, `INV-LENS-2`).

### 10.2 The catalogue

Schema evolution is coordinated through the catalogue, which serializes
publication and write-pointer changes under administrative authority. Catalogue
mutations travel as admin-gated
`SyncMessage::{PublishSchemaWithLens, PublishLens, SetCurrentWriteSchema}`
messages with `CatalogueAck` replies; a non-admin author is rejected
(`INV-LENS-3`). `AuthorId::SYSTEM` is the catalogue admin.

Exactly one database-wide catalogue sequencer assigns a dense monotone
`CatalogueSeq`. An arbitrary core or replica never assigns catalogue sequence;
edges forward authenticated, prevalidated requests to that sequencer. Catalogue
sequence is an administrative ordering domain, not a Jazz data transaction and
not branch causality. A receiver parks an envelope whose earlier catalogue
sequence or active source schema is missing. The same sequence with different
canonical content is fatal catalogue corruption, not first-arrival wins.
Validation happens before consuming sequence. If a sequenced operation must be
abandoned after assignment, the sequencer emits a replicated tombstone for that
slot so Active/tombstoned catalogue order remains dense.

The database lineage records one durable **genesis schema** at creation. Genesis
is not whichever schema a replica happens to supply at open: a joining replica
must install the durable genesis plus the ordered active catalogue chain before
accepting pointers or data. Genesis's local physical mapping is allocated during
database bootstrap and it is the only schema that has no lineage-defining
parent lens. Every other schema enters the
catalogue through one `PublishSchemaWithLens` bundle. The bundled lens MUST
target the bundled schema and source an already-admitted schema. The bundle
also carries exhaustive, explicit new-table and dropped-table declarations;
those declarations and the lens table endpoints MUST partition the source and
target table sets without duplicates or omissions. A standalone unknown
`PublishSchema` is invalid, and a later standalone `PublishLens` may add a
cross-lens but cannot redefine a schema's physical mapping.

Opening an existing database with a caller-supplied schema that disagrees with
its durable genesis is a hard bootstrap error. A joiner with no local lineage
installs the authority's genesis record, then replays the dense Active/tombstone
catalogue chain, then applies pointers and data; it never manufactures genesis
from its preferred client schema.

The pre-sequence request has its own content-addressed identity, distinct from both
`SchemaVersionId` and `MigrationLensId`. Its canonical digest covers catalogue
schema, lens, and the sorted exhaustive new/dropped table declarations, but not
the later assigned `CatalogueSeq`. The sequencer wraps that request in a
committed sequence envelope. An exact envelope replay is idempotent; an exact
request retry is deduplicated before assigning a second slot. A new
`PublishSchemaWithLens` request always rejects a target already reserved by an
earlier request. A separate `PublishLens` operation is the only way to add an
agreeing cross-lens. Reusing a request id, sequence, or target for different
canonical content fails before id allocation, registration, or durable mutation.

`CurrentWriteSchema` is the single moving write pointer. Updates are monotone by
`revision`, and a stale revision is acknowledged with `applied: false` without
changing the pointer (`INV-LENS-7`).

A commit unit or shape registration that names an unknown schema version cannot
be interpreted yet, so it **parks** as a catalogue orphan. The orphan drains
only after the complete schema-and-lineage bundle is durable and its Groove
variants are registered (`INV-LENS-5`, `INV-LENS-6`, ch. 8). There is no
partially-known or provisionally writeable schema state.

Current-pointer messages and child schema bundles whose dependencies are not
Active park durably across reopen. They retry after each activation, in
catalogue order; a transient missing dependency is not a terminal rejection and
never exposes the pointer early.

### 10.3 Shared physical storage

Physical storage preserves the version under which data was stored. Every stored
content/register row carries a `schema_version` ref, represented locally as a
node-local `SchemaVersionAlias` resolving to the wire `SchemaVersionId`.
Compatible schema versions share the `PhysicalTableId` established by their
published lenses while retaining distinct Groove descriptor variants
(`INV-LENS-4`, ch. 2).

Publishing a non-genesis schema first derives its complete physical mapping
from the bundled lineage lens: compatible unchanged/renamed tables and columns
reuse source physical ids; added tables, added/copied columns, and incompatible
column epochs receive fresh ids; dropped entities simply have no target logical
mapping. Schema, lens, local alias, mapping, declarations, and catalogue
sequence are first committed durably with state `Staged`. Staged definitions
are invisible to schema APIs, write-pointer updates, writes, shapes, and commit
admission. Jazz then idempotently builds or rebuilds all physical tables,
indexes, row-layout variants, and projection cases. Only after that succeeds
does a second durable catalogue transaction mark the bundle `Active`. Reopen
resumes activation of staged bundles deterministically before exposing the
node. Only `Active` causes acknowledgement or parked-work drainage
(`INV-LENS-9`). IDs allocated by a staged bundle are never reused, including
after failed activation; this makes retry/reopen registration safe without
rollback exposure. The legacy logical `(table, schema-version)` registry
`jazz_partitions` no longer exists; durable `jazz_schema_versions` mappings are
the complete reopen input.

Once activation begins, any registration or Active-marker failure puts the node
in a fail-stop catalogue state: it must not continue serving against the
temporarily installed in-memory schema. Reopen resumes the durable Staged
bundle idempotently and either reaches Active or fails closed again.

Admission validates the entire logical bundle before staging: related source/target
table endpoints are unique and exhaustive with the explicit new/dropped sets;
the ordered ops reproduce each target descriptor exactly; `RenameTable`
payloads agree with their enclosing endpoints; no rename/copy/add collision is
ambiguous; and physical epochs are reused only when representation and merge
semantics are compatible. A publication has no schema-layer byte cap: generic
transport fragmentation carries it atomically across bounded physical frames.
Structural declaration-count, name-length, and operation-count limits are
checked before Groove registration. The initial named limits are
`MAX_SCHEMA_LINEAGE_DECLARATIONS = 4096`,
`MAX_SCHEMA_LINEAGE_NAME_BYTES = 1024`, and
`MAX_SCHEMA_LINEAGE_OPS = 16384`; changing them is a protocol compatibility
decision, not an unreviewed implementation tweak.
Catalogue admin authority comes from the authenticated transport/session
context; the serialized `author` field is provenance and cannot let a forged
client self-declare `SYSTEM` authority.

_Further invariants._ `INV-LENS-8` — durable catalogue schemas, lenses, the
current-write pointer, aliases, and physical mappings survive node restart and
are recovered before the full Groove database is constructed. Aliases and
physical ids are node-local: when a client has already opened and written under
a schema before receiving an authority snapshot, snapshot planning preserves
that schema's local storage identity and reconciles its ancestors and descendants
around the local anchor. Pending local rows therefore remain addressable.

### 10.4 Writes: authored schema variants

New local writes carry the schema selected by `current_write_schema` as their
Groove discriminator and resolve their table and columns through that schema's
durable physical mapping (`INV-LENS-10`).

Incoming work retains the schema under which it was authored, regardless of the
current write pointer (`INV-LENS-11`). Before ingest, Jazz verifies that every
known authored schema has a local alias, physical mapping, and registered Groove
descriptor variant. A schema-and-lineage bundle normally installs those facts
atomically before the schema becomes Active; the ingest preflight also closes
the provisional catalogue compatibility path. An unknown schema still parks
until its complete lineage arrives (`INV-LENS-5`, `INV-LENS-9`).

Compatible schema versions may share one `PhysicalTableId`, but the stored
schema discriminator remains the authored variant. Ingest does not require a
lens projection, and a pointer mismatch alone is never a rejection or rewrite
condition (`INV-LENS-16`). A `RejectSourceDelta` declaration affects an explicit
projection through that lens, not admission of history authored on either side.

A current-write-pointer flip is a core-ordered, monotone catalogue write
(§10.2) and **never invalidates in-flight work**. The pointer selects the schema
for new local authoring; it does not redirect commits another client already
authored under a different Active schema.

### 10.5 Reads: select, then project

Reads begin from storage reality, then project into the requested schema. A read
against schema S resolves its `PhysicalTableId`, selects content/deletion
winners from that shared lineage by the **schema-agnostic `(tx_time, node)`
ordering first**, and only then translates the winning cells into S
(`INV-LENS-12`, ch. 4).

Natural lens projection applies supported operations deterministically in both
directions and rejects unsupported transformations (`INV-LENS-13`). The shape's
`ShapeId` carries the authored `SchemaVersionId`,
so the same AST against two versions is two shapes (`INV-LENS-15`, ch. 6).

Merge strategies (ch. 4) consume candidate values **after** translation into the
reading schema. Because translation is deterministic, merge determinism is
preserved; counter deltas translate as values like any other column.

When multiple registered lens paths connect two schema versions, lens path
selection is deterministic over the schema-version graph. The chosen path is the
shortest path by lens count. Ties are broken by a stable ordering of candidate
endpoints and lens content ids; publication or storage iteration order must not
affect the chosen path. Schema updates are rare, so this is specified as a
clarity-first graph walk rather than a hot-path optimization.

RLS policy evaluation under lenses uses the permission-evaluation schema pinned
by the node/admin policy bundle. Row data is translated into that schema before
predicates are checked. The policy bundle itself is not lens-translated: column
renames, additions, and drops are applied to the data projection, and the pinned
policy AST is evaluated unchanged against that projection (`INV-LENS-19`).

The correctness contract (the oracle): for every non-rejected natural lens delta
sequence, **translate-then-apply equals apply-then-translate** across all known
schema materializations (`INV-LENS-14`).

**Worked example.** A row is first written under schema `v1`, landing in a
physical history lineage with `schema_version = v1`. Atomically publishing `v2`
with its `v1 ↔ v2` lineage lens maps `v2` to that lineage and registers its
descriptor variant. After the write pointer moves, new local writes use the
`v2` discriminator. An older client's later `v1`-authored commit still uses the
`v1` descriptor variant in that shared lineage (`INV-LENS-11`); neither it nor
the original row is rewritten. A `v2` read scans the physical lineage, selects
the winner first, and projects the winning authored variant into `v2`, including
when the winner comes from a settled subscription cache (`INV-LENS-12`).

### 10.6 The lens op surface

The lens operation surface is deliberately small and resolved before it reaches
the core.

**Implementation status.** The current core supports `LensOp::{RenameTable,
RenameColumn, CopyColumn, AddColumn, DropColumn, TransformColumn,
RejectSourceDelta}`. Natural projection accepts `TransformColumn` only for a
registered transform that declares bijective, canonical-equality-preserving
semantics (`INV-LENS-17`). The current registry contains only the identity/no-op
keys `jazz.identity` and `identity`; `registered_transform_column_identity_is_accepted_and_projected`
and `transform_column_rejects_unregistered_transform_at_publish` cover that
surface. Additional transform keys are status work, not an invariant.

Large-value text/blob columns may be renamed, but `TransformColumn` over their
content is rejected at lens publication (`INV-LENS-18`). **The core only ever
receives resolved lenses**: a draft lens, such as an ambiguous diff where a
drop+add might be a rename, is a product/tooling concept, and the validation tool
refuses unresolved drafts upstream.

Large-value checkpoints, payload handles, and extent references remain portable
logical identities qualified by authored schema. Database-local
`PhysicalTableId` and `PhysicalColumnId` values never cross those API/wire
boundaries; local resolution happens only at the storage boundary.

### 10.9 Subsumed schema-file and schema-subset notes

The former schema manager and schema file notes are folded into the catalogue
model here. Developer-authored `schema.ts`, `permissions.ts`, and migration/lens
modules are source material for immutable `SchemaVersion` and `MigrationLens`
catalogue entries. CLI validation, dev-server loading, runtime open, and server
conversion must share one executable-schema gate so a schema accepted by one
path is not later rejected by another.

Column defaults are schema metadata but execute at the write origin: omitted
defaulted fields become explicit cells in the committed payload before policy
dry-runs and before sealing. Literal defaults are in scope; dynamic defaults such
as `now()` require a deterministic authority/origin rule before they can be
accepted. Merge-strategy-only changes still change schema identity because they
change future merge behavior.

## Open Questions

### Open questions

- 🔶 **Binding-facing lens facade.** TS/WASM/NAPI should expose published
  schemas, migration lenses, current-write-schema movement, and catalogue acks
  as stable facade operations rather than leaking partition-table details. The
  ABI should use opaque `SchemaVersionId`/`MigrationLensId` bytes plus structured
  validation errors and deterministic golden fixtures for natural lens behavior.
- 🔶 **Catalogue admin set.** `AuthorId::SYSTEM` is the catalogue admin; the
  implementation has no broader admin set.
- 🔶 **Policy pin movement validation.** Schema versions/lenses may be published
  ahead of the permission-evaluation pin moving, but policy stays on the pinned
  schema until the admin moves the pin — at which point the new current schema
  must have a valid bundle, and a lens that drops a column referenced by the
  active bundle is rejected at publish (same family as the
  missing-backwards-default check).
- 🔶 **Explicit schema-version GC.** `INV-LENS-20` forbids automatic deletion of
  published physical lineages or authored variants. If explicit GC is ever added, what completeness,
  branch/history, lens, and audit evidence must authorize it?
- 🔶 **Multiple-parent schema lineage.** Initial admission has exactly one
  lineage-defining parent. Later cross-lenses may add translation paths but may
  not change physical placement. If a future schema must inherit physical
  identities from multiple independently evolved parents, define an atomic
  multi-parent lineage proof rather than making arrival order authoritative.
- 🔶 **Catalogue sequence unification.** Schema-lineage activation requires an
  authoritative database-wide monotone catalogue sequence. Current-write
  pointers and later ordered catalogue mutations should enter the same sequence;
  the remaining work is migrating the pointer API from its legacy independent
  revision field to the common committed envelope.
- 🔶 **`RenameTable` payload.** `RenameTable`'s payload is ignored in favor of
  `TableLens` source/target during evaluation. Decide whether the op should be
  removed or the redundant payload should be validated.
- 🔶 **Catalogue as a separate lane.** The design distributes the catalogue on a
  lane beside read/write sync; the protocol has the message variants but no
  separate-lane enforcement (ch. 8).
- 🔶 **Schema-projected source nodes.** Some projected historical/current reads
  still materialize rows inside the source resolver. Decide the
  first-class lowered source-node surface for schema/lens projections so
  projected sources compose with the normal query graph instead of staying as an
  inline resolver path.
- 🔶 **Shared core-supported schema gate.** Keep CLI publish, dev server schema
  load, native/WASM runtime open, and server conversion on one validator until
  the public schema vocabulary and executable core support converge.
- 🔶 **Dynamic defaults.** Literal defaults are write-origin expansion; dynamic
  defaults need a deterministic time/source rule and policy ordering before they
  can enter the executable subset.
- 🔶 **Column metadata.** Arbitrary column metadata can help generated UIs, but
  must be versioned, preserved through lenses, and kept separate from executable
  policy/planner semantics unless explicitly promoted.
- 🔶 **Lens hardening.** Preserve hidden newer fields under old-client writes,
  make lens-path selection ambiguity-aware, allow corrected or asymmetric
  migrations where safe, and define type-changing migrations.
- 🔶 **Authored-column presence through lenses.** `INV-HIST-8` distinguishes an
  explicitly authored unchanged cell from materialized inherited context, while
  `INV-LENS-11`/`INV-LENS-14` require old-schema deltas to translate through
  lens paths. Define how authored presence propagates through `RenameColumn`,
  `CopyColumn`, `AddColumn`, `DropColumn`, and `TransformColumn`. Until that
  contract exists, a lens-translated version deliberately marks presence
  unavailable and conservatively treats every present translated payload cell
  as authored; this is not a claim of per-column LWW fidelity across a lens.
